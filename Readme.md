github.com/ybkimm/gov
=====================
An another [Go](https://golang.org) version manager.

There is a well-known project, [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm),
created for the simular purpose as this project.

In fact, gov does *not managing* version of go.

It's just a small program that downloads an archive,
puts it in a specific folder and gives you access
to the downloaded binaries with a short command like `gov 1.12.12 env`.

That's all. it doesn't touch anything else.
